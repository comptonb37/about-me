# about-me
Brian was born in Tampa, Florida in 1997. His parents were able to give him everything he could have possibly needed with reason, and they always worked hard to make sure his needs were fulfilled. 

Brian attended Academy at the Lakes and graduated in 2016. There, he discovered his love for forensic science, but has no toleration for blood so he feared his future in this field was over. His parents, however, showed him all of the possible areas of study in forensic science, and he found a strong interest in computer science and forensics. Brian has always been fascinated with computers, and his parents fueled his interest with lessons in computer hardware and programs from a young age, but he always wanted to learn more about their intricacies.

After Academy, Brian applied to and was approved for admission to Allegheny College in 2016. There he decided to test his desire to study computer science. His findings were astounding; he already knows that he wants to major in the field and find opportunities to study the field at all times! He is currently taking an english course focused around the field and is excited to share his experiences with the field while developing his english and programming skills. He is also what many would call a "choir nerd," and is considering major in vocal performance, but always wishes to prioritize his discoveries and innovations in the field of computer science.
